## What's the link to the tournament / tournaments viewer again?

[fortylove.net/tournaments](/tournaments)

## The tournament site is down or having problems. What gives?

Maybe the server is overloaded? Maybe the site owner is on vacation? Free websites don't pay the bills. Consider donating by buying the owner a cofee (better yet, donate enought to cover a tournament entry fee). That could help him upgrade server equipment. The tennis gods will look favorably upon you.
