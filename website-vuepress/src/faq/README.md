## The tournament site link is down or having problems. Why?

Reach out: **_admin :cyclone: geekjournal.com_**.

<div class="mb-4"> </div>

Also consider that the server may be overloaded? Or maybe I'm on vacation? Free websites don't pay the bills. Consider donating by buying me a can of high quality tennis balls (better yet, donate enough to cover a tournament entry fee). That could help me upgrade serve equipment (get it? :wink:). The tennis gods will look favorably upon you.

## My Starred Favorities are missing or not saved

Starred favorites currently use local browser storage. Any time you clear your browser cache, these favorites will be wiped. The advantage is that the information is stored locally in your browser, and no information is transmitted over the internet. I'm considering implementing an ability to save favorites onto our servers. The downsides to that approach are (1) longer development time, (2) you will need to login at least once so that you can be remembered and your favorites can be reloaded should you ever clear your browser cache (requiring you to login again)/

## I can't pinch ZOOM in on the tournament info, and the text is too small

You can change the font size by going to the main menu and sellecting `Settings`.
From there you can change the font size. Pinch-to-zoom can be enabled in most browsers (as an override). Google search "enable pinch-to-zoom in chrome on android"

## Is this site affilliated with the USTA?

No. I did, however, obtain verbal permission from an executive of USTA before creating this website.

## What's the link to the tournament viewer again?
