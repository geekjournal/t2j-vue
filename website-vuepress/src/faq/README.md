## The tournament site link is down or having problems. What gives?

Maybe the server is overloaded? Maybe the site owner is on vacation? Free websites don't pay the bills. Consider donating by buying the owner a cofee (better yet, donate enought to cover a tournament entry fee). That could help him upgrade server equipment. The tennis gods will look favorably upon you.

## I can't pinch ZOOM in on the tournament info, and the text is too small

I am aware of this and I've been working on a technical solution, but it will likely require a complete rewrite of the app. In the mean time, you can bump up the text size in your browser, or try turning your mobile into landscape mode. For those of us with poor up-close vision, I'll continue working on a solution. Let me know if this feature is important to you.

## Is this site affilliated with the USTA?

No. I did, however, obtain permission from an executive of USTA before creating this website.

## What's the link to the tournament viewer again?
