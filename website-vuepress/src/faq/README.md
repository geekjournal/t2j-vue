## The tournament site link is down or having problems. What gives?

Maybe the server is overloaded? Maybe the site owner is on vacation? Free websites don't pay the bills. Consider donating by buying the owner a cofee (better yet, donate enought to cover a tournament entry fee). That could help him upgrade server equipment. The tennis gods will look favorably upon you.

## My Starred Favorities are missing or not saved

Starred favorites currently use local browser storage. Any time you clear your browser cache, these favorites will be wiped. The advantage is that the information is stored locally in your browser, and no information is transmitted over the internet. I'm considering implementing an ability to save favorites onto our servers. The downsides to that approach are (1) longer development time, (2) you will need to login at least once so that you can be remembered and your favorites can be reloaded should you ever clear your browser cache (requiring you to login again)/

## I can't pinch ZOOM in on the tournament info, and the text is too small

I am aware of this and I've been working on a technical solution, but it will likely require a complete rewrite of the app. In the mean time, you can bump up the text size in your browser, or try turning your mobile into landscape mode. For those of us with poor up-close vision, I'll continue working on a solution. Let me know if this feature is important to you.

## Is this site affilliated with the USTA?

No. I did, however, obtain permission from an executive of USTA before creating this website.

## What's the link to the tournament viewer again?
